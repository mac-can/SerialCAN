## Utility program `can_test`

`can_test` is a command line tool to test CAN communication.
Originally developed for electronic environmental tests on an embedded Linux system with SocketCAN,
IÂ´m using it for many years as a traffic generator for CAN stress-tests.

## CAN Interface API, Version 3

**CAN API V3** is a wrapper specification by UV Software to have a uniform CAN Interface API for various CAN interfaces from different vendors running under multiple operating systems.

## Git repo `can_test`

This repo only contains the source code for the utility program `can_test` to be integrated into CAN API V3 wrapper implementations as a git submodule.
