## Utility program `can_moni`

`can_moni` is a command line tool to view incoming CAN messages.
I hate this messing around with binary masks for identifier filtering.
So I wrote this little program to have an exclude list for single identifiers or identifier ranges (see program option `--exclude` or just `-x`).
Precede the list with a `~` and you get an include list.

## CAN Interface API, Version 3

**CAN API V3** is a wrapper specification by UV Software to have a uniform CAN Interface API for various CAN interfaces from different vendors running under multiple operating systems.

## Git repo `can_moni`

This repo only contains the source code for the utility program `can_moni` to be integrated into CAN API V3 wrapper implementations as a git submodule.
