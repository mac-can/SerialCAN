### Driver for CAN-over-Serial-Line Interfaces (SLCAN Protocol)

# CAN API V3 Driver for CAN-over-Serial-Line Interfaces

CAN API V3 is a wrapper specification to have a uniform CAN Interface API for various CAN interfaces from different vendors running under multiple operating systems.

This repo contains the source code for a _CAN-over-Serial-Line_ driver based on
[Lawicel SLCAN protocol](http://www.can232.com/docs/canusb_manual.pdf).
It provides the build environments to build dynamic libraries with GNU C/C++&reg; compilers,
either as a C++ class library ([_libSerialCAN_](#libSerialCAN)),
or as a _CAN API V3_ driver library ([_libUVCANSLC_](#libUVCANSLC)),
as well as some C/C++ example programs ([`can_moni`](can_moni-for-serialcan) and [`can_test`](can_test-for-serialcan)).

### Build Targets

_Important note_: To build any of the following build targets run the `build_no.sh` script to generate a pseudo build number.
```
uv-pc013mac:~ eris$ cd ~/Projects/MacCAN/SerialCAN/Sources/
uv-pc013mac:Sources eris$ ./build_no.sh
```
Repeat this step after each `git commit`, `git pull`, `git clone`, etc.

Then go back to root folder and compile the whole _bleep_ by typing the usual commands:
```
uv-pc013mac:Sources eris$ cd ~/Projects/MacCAN/SerialCAN
uv-pc013mac:SerialCAN eris$ make clean
uv-pc013mac:SerialCAN eris$ make all
uv-pc013mac:SerialCAN eris$ sudo make install
```
_(The version number of the libraries can be adapted by editing the `Makefile`s in the subfolders and changing the variable `VERSION` accordingly.)_

#### libSerialCAN

___libSerialCAN___ is a dynamic library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C++__ applications.
See header file `SerialCAN.h` for a description of all class members.

#### libUVCANSLC

___libUVCANSLC___ is a dynamic library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C__ applications.
See header file `can_api.h` for a description of all API functions.

#### libSLCAN

___libSLCAN___ is a dynamic library with a basic SLCAN application programming interface for use in __C__ applications.
See header file `slcan.h` for a description of all API functions.

#### can_moni for SerialCAN

`can_moni` is a command line tool to view incoming CAN messages.
I hate this messing around with binary masks for identifier filtering.
So I wrote this little program to have an exclude list for single identifiers or identifier ranges (see program option `--exclude` or just `-x`). Precede the list with a `~` and you get an include list.

Type `can_moni --help` to display all program options.

#### can_test for SerialCAN

`can_test` is a command line tool to test CAN communication.
Originally developed for electronic environmental tests on an embedded Linux system with SocketCAN, IÂ´m using it for many years as a traffic generator for CAN stress-tests.

Type `can_test --help` to display all program options.

## Known Bugs and Caveats

1. To probe a CAN channel is not supported.

2. Time-stamps are currently not supported.

3. Serial line attributes (baud rate and mode) cannot be changed
   (default: 115.2kBaud, 8-N-1).

4. Transmitting messages over the TTY is extremely slow; approx. 16ms per frame.
   I guess this is because the transmission is acknowledged by the CAN device.

5. Findings from Code Analysis:
   The companion module `can_btr.c` contains some dead stores.

6. No libraries are build under Cygwin; only the example programs
   [`can_moni`](can_moni-for-serialcan) and [`can_test`](can_test-for-serialcan).
